{"Artist(s)": "\"Weird Al\" Yankovic", "song": "Jackson Park Express", "text": "[Verse 1]\nTuesday morning, 8:15\nI was riding to work on the\nJackson Park Express\nSeemed like any other day\nThen my whole world changed\nIn a way I never could have guessed\nCause she walked in\nTook the seat right across the aisle\nI knew we had a special connection\nThe second I saw her smile\n\nShe smiled as if to say\n\"Hello, Haven't seen you on this bus before\"\nI gave her a look that said\n\"Huh, Life is funny, you never know what's in store\nBy the way, your hair is beautiful\nI bet it smells like raisins\"\n\nShe looked at me in a way that asked\n\"Did you have a nose job or something?\nI'm only asking, cause your nose looks slightly better\nThan the rest of your face\"\nI arched my eyebrow, ever so slightly\nWhich was my way of asking\n\"Do you want my old Hewlett-Packard printer?\nIt still works, Kinda\nAnd I got a bunch of ink cartridges left\"\nThen, she let out a long sigh\nWhich, I took to mean, \"Uh\nMama, What is that deodorant you're wearing?\nIt's intoxicating\nWhy don't we drive out to the country sometime?\nAnd collect deer ticks in a zip-lock baggie\", Oh yeah\n\nI gave her a penetrating stare\nWhich could only mean\n\"You are my answer, my answer to everything\nWhich is why, I'll probably do very poorly\nOn the written part of my driver's test\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYes, It all happened\nOn the Jackson Park Express\nOn the Jackson Park Express\nOn the Jackson Park Express\nOn the Jackson Park Express\n\n[Verse 2]\nI knew she was starting to fall for me\nCause she crinkled her nose, which unmistakably meant\n\"Baby, lets wear each other's clothes\nAnd speak in a thick German accent\nAnd, maybe someday we can own and operate\nOur own mobile pet-grooming service\"\nI couldn't hold back my feelings\nI gave her a look, that said\n\"I would make any sacrifice for your love\nGoat, chicken, whatever\nI could never hold you close enough\nLet's have our bodies surgically grafted together\nOh, surgically grafted together\"\nShe picked up her newspaper, and started reading to herself\nWhich I'm sure, was a way of telling me\n\"When you're cold, I will warm you\nWhen you're shivering, I will hold you\nWhen you're nauseous, I will give you Pepto-Bismol every hour\nFor as long as the symptoms persist\nOh, I, I never, ever want to see you cry\nSo, please let me cauterize your tear ducts with an arc welder\"\nThen, I glanced down, at her shirt, for a second\nIn a way that clearly implied\n\"I like your boobs\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI cleared my throat quietly, and then, I looked away\nAnd I'm sure it was obvious to her, just what I was trying to say\nI was trying to say, \"Hey\nI'd like to make a wall-sized mural out of all the dead skin cells\nThat you slough off while you sleep at night\"\nWhoa-o-Oh, \"I'd like to rip you wide open\nAnd french-kiss every single one of your internal organs\nOh, I'd like to remove all your skin, and wear your skin, over my own skin\nBut not in a creepy way\"\n\nThen, I'm pretty sure, she looked at me, out of the corner of her good eye\nAnd, though, she never spoke a word, this is exactly what I heard\nShe was saying, \"Oh!\nI wanna make out with you, in an abandoned toll-booth, in the middle of a monsoon\nI wanna ride dolphins with you, in the moonlight\nUntil the staff at Sea World kicks us out\nI want you inside me, oh, like a tapeworm\"\nI pointed to the side of my mouth, as a way of indicating\n\"Hey, I think you got something on the side of your mouth\"\nShe licked the corner of her lips, as if to say\n\"Here?\", I nodded, implying, \"Yeah, you got it\"\n\nAnd, then the bus stopped, at 53rd Street, and she got up suddenly\n\"Where are you going?\", pleaded my eyes, \"Baby, don't you do this to me\nThink of the beautiful children we could have someday\nWe could school them at home, Raise them up the right way\nAnd protect them from the evils of the world\nLike Trigonometry and Prime Numbers, oh no\nBaby, please don't go\"\n\nShe brushed my leg, as she left the bus\nI'm sure that was her way of saying\n\"I'm sorry this just isn't working out\nYou're suffocating me\nI need some space to find out what life's all about\nSo, goodbye forever, my love\"\n\nAnd deep inside, I knew she was right\nIt was time for us both to move on\nAnd though, I never got her number, oh no no\nShe never bothered to leave her address, oh\nBut, as long as I live, I'll never forget\nThose precious moments we shared together\n\n[Outro]\nOn the Jackson Park Express\nOn the Jackson Park

and I'm manic\nFeeling panicked, I need a Xanax\nPass it, as I OD real slowly\nLonely, looking ghostly\nSurrounded by smoky mirror images of a fictionist, sober me\nDon't give a fuck about harming

brain glowing\nEverything is bending in the same motion\nRoll the blunt, I'll take a hit\nStart staring at the smoke, as it twists and disappears\nPeer pressure don't affect me, bitch, I take drugs on my own\nPop a perc' and snort some coke\nIt feel like my heart is broke because I get fucked up when I feel alone\nI'm choking on this forty of OE, I'm hopin' that I don't breathe\nBitch, I'm dope, act like you know me\nShoot me up so I can OD\n\n[Outro: Gangsta Boo]\nMask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high\nMillion blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind", "Length":
